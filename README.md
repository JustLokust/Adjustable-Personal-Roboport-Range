# Adjustable Personal Roboport Range

You ever have a bunch of roboports in your armor and drop down a huge blueprint? Perhaps you are running a lengthy section of belts via blueprints? Maybe deconstructing a large area of many entities? You know what happens, bots start flying miles away and you stand there thinking "If I could run around the blueprint, with the bots staying by me, they would be done in a fraction of the time!". Or another scenario, you have a large blueprint down but only want to build small sections at a time. With Adjustable Personal Roboport Range, you will be able to reduce the radius of your personal roboport range so you can run around while your bots go optimal distance. You can even disable construction bots entirely.

Action Keys:
-Increase Range by ']' key.
-Decrease Range by '[' key.
-Toggle Construction off\on by "CONTROL + ["
-Toggle Min Range by "SHIFT + ["
-Toggle Max Range by "SHIFT + ]"

Works with Multiplayer.

NOTE:
-When you remove this mod, with an custom range in effect, some personal roboports may disappear from your equipped armor. There are checks to make sure that custom roboports aren't spread across the game in different armors. So this SHOULD only effect your equipped armor. (Its a bug if it doesn't)

Mod Compatibility:
- Does not work with "Closest First"
- This mod works by swapping out the personal roboports in the players equipped armor with custom ranged roboports. Due to this, some mods that add new personal roboport items will have unexpected results.
- This mod should work with all armor mods. I tested it with bobs armors and it worked fine.
